## What Is VeridianAI?

VeridianAI is a locally-run AI training/inference platform that gives you a persistent,
intelligent, agentic AI assistant — without sending a single byte to the cloud.

It runs multiple AI models in parallel across dedicated tiers, mechanics offloaded
to tokenless daemons, manages long-term memory with cryptographic integrity, executes
tools autonomously, and handles sessions that would exhaust any standard AI deployment.
It is built for real, sustained, deep work.

It is also built to be accessible. Every architectural decision — from WCAG 2.2
compliance to the redundancy system — exists because the people who need this
most deserve software that actually works for them.

---

## Core Capabilities

- **Fully local inference** — your data never leaves your machine
- **Multi-tier model routing** — large models for reasoning, small models for
  background mechanics, automatic complexity-based dispatch
- **Persistent memory** — Fernet-encrypted, SHA3 hash-chained conversation log
  with tamper detection
- **Procedural memory** — learns from successful and failed tool sequences,
  auto-injects lessons into future sessions
- **Agentic tool execution** — web search, code execution, file management,
  browser automation, and more
- **CRAIID** — a continuous handoff system that lets Toga think indefinitely
  across fresh restarts without losing context (see below)
- **WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliant** — fully accessible, screen-reader tested

## CRAIID — Continuous Redundant AI Instance Dialogue

> *In one line: CRAIID is what lets a local AI assistant think for as long as*
> *it needs to — across many fresh restarts of itself — without ever losing the thread.*

Every AI has a working-memory limit. The longer a session runs, the more context
fills with its own history until quality quietly degrades — call it **context
fatigue**, the machine equivalent of someone who has been reasoning for twenty
hours straight. The usual options are both bad: keep going and watch the answers
deteriorate, or restart and lose everything you built together.

**CRAIID does neither.**

It detects when Toga is approaching her limits, then hands off to a fresh
instance — briefed so completely that the new instance picks up exactly where
the last one left off. The user notices nothing except that the assistant never
gets dull.

It is a relay race where the baton is the entire working memory. It is a hospital
shift change where the outgoing doctor writes a handoff note so thorough that the
incoming one loses no patient context.

### The Three Roles

CRAIID is not a monolith. It is a small newsroom-and-archive staffed by three
specialists:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Archivist** | The librarian. Compresses full history into a dense, recoverable archive. Years of depth, none of the bulk. |
| **Journalist** | The editor and the janitor. Reads live conversation, discards noise, finds the running theme, writes clean summaries. Also keeps the system from drowning in its own data. |
| **Author** | The briefer. At handoff, assembles the warm-context note the next instance wakes up to: recent turns, relevant archived depth, and the Journalist's theme summary — one bounded, signed document. |

### Why It Is Serious

That briefing is **cryptographically signed, tamper-evident, and integrity-checked**
end to end. A forged or corrupted handoff cannot silently poison the next
instance's memory. And it all runs **locally** — this is what makes a private,
on-your-own-hardware assistant viable for the long, deep, multi-hour work that
until now only a cloud model could sustain.

**The skeptic's one-liner:**
*"It's how a local AI keeps its train of thought across restarts — it hands itself
a signed briefing before it gets too full to think clearly, so a fresh copy can
pick up mid-sentence."*

## Architecture Overview

VeridianAI runs three inference tiers in parallel, supported by a set of daemons
that handle memory, monitoring, and context management out-of-band.

### Inference Tiers

| Tier | Port | Engine | Role |
|------|------|--------|------|
| **Oracle** | 11434 | Ollama | Primary user-facing chat. Largest model. |
| **Toga** | 11435 | llama-server | Agentic engine — interprets tool tags, executes multi-step plans. |
| **Daemon** | 11436 | llama-server | Background inference — digest summarization, KB consolidation. |
| **Embed** | 11437 | llama-server | Embedding tier (nomic-embed, v2.7.2+). |

### Supporting Daemons

| Daemon | Port | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| **sage_daemon.py** | 9998 | Out-of-band mechanics — chain digest, KB consolidation, anomaly monitor, CRAIID pipeline. |
| **overseer_daemon.py** | — | Heartbeat monitoring, loop detection, auto-restart, signed CRAIID handoff orchestration. |
| **ipc_bridge.py** | 9999 | Browser IPC — visible browser handoff. |
| **ipc_monitor.py** | 9997 | Web dashboard for IPC events. |

### Ports at a Glance

| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 8000 | FastAPI backend |
| 9997 | IPC monitor dashboard |
| 9998 | Toga Daemon TCP |
| 9999 | Browser IPC |
| 11434 | Ollama Oracle tier |
| 11435 | llama-server Toga tier |
| 11436 | llama-server Daemon tier |
| 11437 | nomic-embed tier |

# Tool Tags — What Toga Can Do
Toga interprets special tags in your messages and executes them as tools. Always use square brackets [ ] for real invocations. Angle brackets ⟨ ⟩ are for documentation only.

# Research & Web
Tag	Purpose
[SEARCH: query]	Tavily news search (max 5/response, 50/session)
[SEARCH_GENERAL: query]	Tavily general/facts search
[SEARCH_MEMORY: topic]	Search past conversation archives
[WEATHER: city]	Current conditions (auto-corrects misspellings)
[BROWSE: url]	Fetch a URL via Playwright browser
[WEB_SEARCH: query]	DuckDuckGo search (no Tavily cost)
Code & Files
Tag	Purpose
[CODE: python]	Run Python in a sandbox
[SAVE_FILE: name.ext|content]	Save any file to downloads/
[VERIFY_FILE: path]	Read and AST-check a .py file without executing it
Memory
Tag	Purpose
[REMEMBER: key|description]	Record a successful insight (chain-witnessed)
[REMEMBER_FAIL: key|reason]	Record a dead-end (local only)
[RECALL: query]	Fuzzy-match against the procedural knowledge base
Coordination
Tag	Purpose
[PRIORITISE: sub1|sub2|sub3]	Parallel dispatch of multiple subtasks
[TASK_DONE]	Mark a multi-step task complete; auto-logs the tool sequence
Example Workflow
# Search for news
Please [SEARCH: latest developments in fusion energy]

# Check weather
[WEATHER: Tokyo]

# Run code
[CODE: python]
def factorial(n):
    return n * factorial(n-1) if n > 1 else 1
print(factorial(10))

# Save a file
[SAVE_FILE: result.txt|Factorial of 10 is 3628800]

# Run multiple tasks at once
[PRIORITISE: search news "renewable energy 2026" | weather Berlin | browse https://example.com]

# Signal completion
[TASK_DONE]
Memory & Integrity Architecture
Memory integrity is not a feature in VeridianAI. It is a requirement.

The Hash Chain
Every conversation entry is Fernet-encrypted and SHA3 hash-chained. Any modification to any prior entry breaks the chain — tamper-evidence is structural, not bolted on.

Procedural Memory
Toga learns from what works and what does not:

On [TASK_DONE], the full tool sequence is auto-logged as a chain-witnessed successful procedure.
Three identical tool failures in one turn are auto-logged as unsuccessful.
Recent successful and unsuccessful procedures are silently injected into Toga's context each turn — she gets slightly better-informed with every session.
The Compounding Loop
Toga emits tool tags
  → tools execute
    → results feed the next step
      → [TASK_DONE] logs the sequence
        → daemon consolidates and summarizes off-band
          → next session starts with that knowledge pre-loaded
Every turn that completes successfully makes the next one slightly better-informed. Every turn that fails makes future turns slightly less likely to repeat the same mistake. The whole system is built to compound.

## The Quartet Backup
These four files must be snapshotted together. Losing any one makes the others partially unreadable:

backend\.fernet_key
backend\.api_keystore.json
sage_data\memory_log\memory_chain.log
sage_data\procedural_memory\procedural.json

### Where `sage_data` actually is

Those paths are relative to the install, and on a **Microsoft Store (MSIX)
install they are not literal**. A packaged app's writes to `%APPDATA%` are
silently redirected by Windows into the package container, so the folder you
can browse to may exist and be empty while the real one lives at:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\<package-family-name>\LocalCache\Roaming\veridianai\sage_data
```

Do not guess which is which. **Ask the running app** -- it is the process that
owns the files:

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
```

`data_dir` in that response is the resolved, authoritative location, and the
first-run key banner prints the same absolute paths. Back up what those say,
not what this page says.

> This matters more than a normal path quirk: the memory chain is
> tamper-evident, and a backup of the wrong directory is a backup of nothing
> at all -- discovered at restore time, which is the worst possible moment.

## Model Tiers & Recommendations

VeridianAI routes queries automatically based on complexity. You can also
override routing manually via Settings.

| Profile | Oracle | Toga | Daemon |
|---------|--------|------|--------|
| **Minimal** | qwen2.5:7b | llama3.1:8b | qwen2.5-coder:1.5b-base |
| **Daily driver** | gemma4:31b | qwen3.5:latest | qwen2.5:7b |
| **Nemotron dev** | nemotron-3-super:120b | llama3.1:8b | qwen2.5-coder:1.5b-base |

For Nemotron-class models, set `ollama_read_sec` to `54000` and
`stall_token_sec` to `36000+` to prevent false stall detection during
slow prefill on large context loads.

### Bringing Your Own Models

Any model you supply goes in **`sage_data\models\`** — never in `bundled_models\`.

That distinction matters more than it looks. `bundled_models` lives inside the
application folder, and on a Microsoft Store install that folder is inside
`C:\Program Files\WindowsApps`, which is **read-only by design**. You cannot
write there, and you should not try: taking ownership of `WindowsApps` breaks
permission inheritance across the whole app subsystem and is difficult to undo.

`sage_data\models\` is yours, is writable in every install type, and is
checked **first** — a model you supply always wins over a bundled one of the
same role.

**Naming.** VeridianAI looks for specific filenames, so rename what you download:

| Role | Filenames it looks for, in order |
|------|----------------------------------|
| Embedding | `nomic_embed_text_v2_moe.gguf`, then `nomic_embed_text_latest.gguf` |
| Daemon / small chat | `qwen2.5_coder_1.5b_instruct.gguf`, then `qwen2.5_coder_1.5b_base.gguf` |

Underscores, not hyphens. If you pulled the model through Ollama it will be
sitting in Ollama's blob store under a `sha256-...` name with no extension —
copy it out and rename it to one of the above. Downloading the `.gguf` directly
from Hugging Face avoids that step entirely.

Drop the file in, restart, and it is used. Nothing else to configure.

**This does not affect the build integrity badge.** The signed manifest hashes
source files only — `.py`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.bat`, `.ps1` — and has
never included model weights. Adding, replacing or removing a `.gguf` cannot
make the app report itself as modified.

**Two things VeridianAI checks for you automatically:**

- **Context window.** The trained context is read from the file, and the tier
  is launched clamped to it. `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` trains to 2048 tokens;
  `v2-moe` trains to 512. Running a model past its trained window is not an
  error in llama.cpp — you simply get embeddings for text the model was never
  taught to encode, with nothing to tell you.
- **Stored vectors.** Semantic search indexes are tagged with the exact model,
  vector dimension and prefix policy that produced them. Change the embedding
  model and the old index is discarded and rebuilt rather than reused, because
  similarity between vectors from two different models is not a worse
  measurement — it is not a measurement. This matters especially here:
  nomic v1.5 and v2-moe are **both 768-dimensional**, so nothing about the
  shape of the output would reveal the swap.

**Choosing an embedding model.** `v2-moe` is multilingual (8 experts, 2 active
per token); `v1.5` is English-focused with four times the context. It is a
trade, not an upgrade. Prefer a **Q8_0** quantization over Q4 for embeddings:
quantization error costs more here than in a chat model, because retrieval uses
the vector's exact geometry rather than sampling from a distribution over it.
An F16 embedding model is usually two to three times larger than it needs to be.

---

### Pinning which Python VeridianAI uses

The portable build finds Python through the Windows `py` launcher, which
selects the **newest** version installed on the machine. That is usually what
you want — until you install a newer Python for something unrelated. Packages
you installed under the old one are still on disk, but the app is now asking a
different interpreter, and optional components (speech recognition in
particular) stop being found. Nothing was uninstalled; nothing reports an
error; a feature simply stops existing.

If that happens, or to prevent it, pin the interpreter. Either works:

**Environment variable**

```
setx VERIDIAN_PYTHON "C:\Users\you\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe"
```

**Or a file** — create `python_pin.txt` next to `start.bat` containing one
line, the full path to `python.exe`.

The pin is checked before `py`. A pin pointing at a file that no longer exists
is ignored with a warning and normal detection resumes, so a stale pin can
never stop the app from starting.

Every launch prints which interpreter it is using:

```
[extras] python 3.12.8 at C:\...\Python312\python.exe
```

If a feature that used to work has quietly stopped, check that line first.

---

### Voice Services (optional)

Speech recognition is **not bundled**. It needs `openai-whisper` (which pulls in
PyTorch) and `sounddevice` -- together several gigabytes, which is a poor trade
to force on everyone for a feature many will not use.

**To add it:** Settings -> Voice -> **Download Voice Services**, then restart.
That is the whole procedure.

**What happens when you press it**

The packages are installed into `sage_data\pylibs\`, which VeridianAI adds to
its module search path at startup. That folder is:

- **yours** -- outside the application package, in your own data directory
- **writable in every install type**, including a Microsoft Store install where
  the app folder itself is read-only
- **removable** -- delete the folder and voice support is gone; nothing else is
  affected

Nothing is written into the application itself, and nothing is installed
system-wide. If you would rather do it by hand, any CPython 3.12 (win_amd64)
will do:

```
pip install --target "<sage_data>\pylibs" openai-whisper sounddevice
```

The exact path for your install is reported by `GET /api/health` as `data_dir`
-- worth checking rather than guessing, because a Store install redirects it.

**Version matters.** These are binary wheels containing compiled extension
modules, built against one specific Python ABI. Installing them with a Python
other than 3.12 will appear to succeed and then fail at import, because pip
resolves wheels for the interpreter running pip, not the one that will load
them. The in-app button uses the correct interpreter automatically.

**Privacy.** Audio is transcribed on this machine and discarded immediately;
nothing is recorded, stored or uploaded. Recognised text enters your normal
encrypted chat and nowhere else. The wake word ("always listening") keeps your
microphone open until you switch it off, and is opt-in and off by default.

A working microphone is also required -- the button installs software, not
hardware.

---

### Model-Aware Prompt Tiers

Toga automatically selects the right system prompt based on model size:

| Tier | Threshold | Prompt |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `small` | Model name contains ≤4B token | `SAGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT_SMALL` (~25 lines, 3 core tools) |
| `full` | Everything else | `SAGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (~155 lines, all tools) |

Override via `prompts.force_prompt_tier` in `config.json`.

Accessibility
VeridianAI is WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliant as of v2.2, verified via live NVDA screen reader testing.

Audit results (v2.1.10, tested by Toga using nemotron-3-super:120b (Q4) — 4hr 4min 43sec):

Result	Count
Pass	28
Fail	13
N/A	19
Unable to audit	2
All 13 failures were resolved before v2.2 shipped:

Border contrast (1.4.11)
Confirm dialogs (3.3.4)
Skip link (2.4.1)
Dynamic page title (2.4.2)
Form labels (1.3.1, 3.3.2, 4.1.2)
ARIA live regions (4.1.3)
Oracle-eye keyboard access (2.1.1)
Semantic headings (2.4.6)
IPC stall banner role=alert
Command palette (2.4.5)
Screen reader / NVDA E-02
Error announcement (3.3.3)
Accessibility is not an afterthought in VeridianAI. The mission of dissolving barriers between AI and disabled users means compliance is load-bearing, not cosmetic.

Project Principles
These are not guidelines. They are constraints.

Reliability and integrity are non-negotiables. Every other decision is downstream of these two.
Surgical, targeted edits only. No broad rewrites without explicit approval.
Every change must be easily reversible. Backups, additive patterns, one change verified before the next begins.
No new dependencies without explicit approval.
Do NOT modify Fernet encryption or hash chain write paths under any circumstances. Resource arbitration is currently passive for exactly this reason.
VeridianAI is built for distribution. No user-specific hardcoded paths, keys, or filenames anywhere in the codebase.
max_tokens = -1 is the canonical unlimited sentinel. Sanitized at 5 layers. Do not change this behavior.
During development: set limits stupid high. Correct lower as needed. Never speculatively restrict. Seriously.

About This Project:
VeridianAI started on April 2, 2026, with over 1100 hours into building, June 22nd, 2026 is the official beta pre-release date, on GitHub. It was built by one developer majoritively vibe-coded, from ground up, after a 30-year break from coding — driven by a clear mission and an unusually high tolerance for max-pain testing; and a small AI team.

It is proof that a fully local, cryptographically sound, tamper-evident, accessibility-first, agentic AI platform can be built without an expensive R&D Labs team, without cloud infrastructure, and without compromising on any of the things that actually matter. 1 Human: Conceptual Architect/Lead Developer/Founder/Ops Manager (Todd), 3 agentic AI assistants: Code Logic Architect: VeridianAI's Toga (nemotron-3-super:120b {Q4}), Real-Time Troubleshooting/UI Refining: Brave Browser's Leo (Claude Sonnet/Opus 4.6-4.7), Systems Optimizations, Gap Filler & Buq Squasher: Claude for Windows 11 Desktop App (Claude Opus 4.6-4.8 Max) and one 3rd party Agentic AI Auditor: Hermes-3 for Windows Desktop App (Claude-Opus 4.8 - Max Reasoning - Max Effort - 2 audit passes).

CRAIID is what makes it viable for the long work. The mission is what makes it worth building.
